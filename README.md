The purpose of this project is gain insights on how different campaigns, specific to plays, fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
The focus of this analysis is to analyze the outcomes (successful, failed and canceled) of theater campaigns, based on their launch date. In order to do this, the following steps needed to be taken prior to conducting the analysis. First, the Kickstarter dataset needed to be further organized by creating a “years” column, in order to extract the year from the “date created conversion” column, which provides further clarity into when the campaign was launched. 

According to the results, we can say that there was some activity in the first months of the year, but it was not until May when the line to launch successful campaigns skyrocketed. May, June and even July were the best performing months of the year. On the other hand, we can see that from August towards the end of the year there was a big decrease in results compared to the previous months and the numbers of successful and failed campaigns were similar. Our graph shows that there were no cancelled theatre campaigns throughout the year.

In order to do this, the following steps needed to be taken prior to conducting the analysis. First, a table needed to be created on a new sheet, within the Kickstarter MS Excel workbook. Excel is a tool that can be used across all Organizations areas, some of the tools are quite easy to follow, but for anyone that is new to Excel, it can be a little bit overwhelming determining the correct formular and their placement to get the results that you need. Also, it is quite confusing to figured out the budget range by using COUNTIFS() formular when from the second database that is provided.
The table aims to capture the outcomes based on campaign funding goals, which are broken down in to 12 groupings, ranging from less than $1,000 up to greater than $50,000.

Two conclusions about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
May is the month with the most successful Kickstarter campaign.
Campaigns are had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched in the Winter time and early Spring. (i.e November-March). As we can see in the line chart, the more funding goal amount increases, the higher chance that the rate of successful projects will decrease. Therefore, Campaigns are more successful when reasonable goals are set.
